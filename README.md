# FUN WITH AI

App can process plain text prompts and produce outputs that are hard to distinguish from human writing. It uses GPT-3 is a powerful AI model created by [openAI](https://beta.openai.com). Check out some [examples](https://beta.openai.com/examples/) of what it can do! GPT-3. I have implemented 
 It uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework with [React](https://reactjs.org/).
 I have used completion endpoint. The completions endpoint can be used for a wide variety of tasks. You input some text as a prompt, and the model will generate a text completion that attempts to match whatever context or pattern you gave it. For example, if you give the API the prompt, "As Descartes said, I think, therefore", it will return the completion " I am" with high probability.
